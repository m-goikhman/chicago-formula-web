## Reading Text: The Attack

At 8:45 PM, Pauline drops Alex off in front of his apartment building. "I have to find parking," she says. Alex gets out and rushes into the building—he's freezing and needs the bathroom.

Someone else has been following them. A blue Honda Civic parks illegally at the corner, half in a snowbank. The driver watches Alex enter the building, then quickly follows.

Meanwhile, Fiona arrives at 8:55 PM. She parks her red Mini Cooper down the street. As she walks to the building, she notices a blue car with a dent on the bumper parked illegally at the corner. Strange.

Fiona has her own key to Alex's apartment—he gave it to her a month ago. She opens the door. The apartment is dark and quiet. "Alex?" she calls. No answer. His coat is on the chair, but where is he? She tries calling his phone, but he doesn't answer.

At 9:00 PM, Pauline finally finds parking. She walks back and buzzes the apartment. Fiona, confused and angry, lets her in.

"Where's Alex?" Pauline asks.

"I don't know!" Fiona says. "He's just... gone!"

The buzzer rings again. It's Tim Kane. "Hey, sorry I'm late!" he says cheerfully. "Parking was crazy!" He acts completely normal.

At 9:10 PM, Ronnie Snapper arrives in his Tesla. As he walks to the building, he notices the blue Honda at the corner. He recognizes it—that's Tim's car, with that distinctive dent. Interesting. The snow on it looks old, like it's been there a while. But Tim just said he arrived late.

Ronnie doesn't say anything. He just remembers.

At 9:12 PM, Pauline needs to use the bathroom. She walks down the hall and opens the door.

Then she screams.

Alex Martin is lying sprawled on the floor, unconscious, in a pool of blood. There's a terrible wound on the back of his head and a gash on his forehead. His eyes are closed.

But he's still breathing.
