## Reading Text: Secrets and Shadows

At 8:05 PM, Pauline quietly leaves the party. She takes the elevator upstairs to Alex and Tim's office. Inside, she sees exactly what she's looking for: a small USB drive shaped like a red fish on Alex's desk. She picks it up and puts it in her pocket. Next to it, there's a marble paperweight on a pile of letters. She doesn't touch it.

But someone is watching. Tim Kane followed her. He saw her take the USB drive. That drive could save him! He could pay Ronnie back and solve all his problems. But how can he get it?

Tim remembers the spare office key under the plant pot. He gets inside after Pauline leaves. Then he sees the marble paperweight on Alex's desk. It's heavy. A terrible idea forms in his mind. Tim puts the paperweight in his coat pocket and leaves quickly.

He tries to catch Pauline in the stairwell, but he runs into Professor Chun and his wife in the hallway. "Oh! Tim!" Professor Chun says, surprised. "What are you doing here?"

Tim's heart is pounding. "I... I just needed some air." He talks nervously for a minute, then hurries away. When he gets back to the party, Pauline is already there with Alex. He's missed his chance.

At 8:30 PM, Alex invites people to his apartment at 9:00 to watch movies. He kisses Fiona goodbye and leaves with Pauline.

Fiona watches them go. She feels angry and confused. After a few minutes, she gets in her red Mini Cooper and follows them.

Tim also leaves the party. He gets into his old blue Honda Civic and follows. The paperweight is still in his pocket.
