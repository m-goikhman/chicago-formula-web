## The Christmas Party 

It's Monday, December 18th, and snow is falling over Chicago. At the University of Chicago Business School, the Finance Department is having their Christmas party. The room is warm and decorated with lights. Students are drinking mulled wine and exchanging Secret Santa gifts.

Alex Martin, a 28-year-old PhD student, arrives at 7:00 PM with his girlfriend, Fiona McAllister. They have been dating for two months. Alex seems different lately—more confident, more relaxed. He even mentioned that he has "come into a lot of money," though he won't say how.

Tim Kane is already at the party. Tim is Alex's office mate, another PhD student. He looks nervous tonight. At 7:15 PM, when the Secret Santa exchange begins, Tim receives a book. When he opens it, he finds a handwritten note inside: **"Pay up or die!"** 

Tim turns pale. He quickly puts the note in his pocket. The note is from Ronnie Snapper, an MBA student with dangerous connections. Tim owes Ronnie money, and Ronnie wants it back before December 24th.

At 7:40 PM, a woman named Pauline Thompson walks into the party. When Alex sees her, his face changes—he looks shocked, maybe angry. He takes her by the arm and leads her to the stairwell.

Fiona watches them leave. Who is this woman? Why does Alex look so worried?

In the hallway, Tim is also watching. He quietly follows them and stands near the stairwell door, listening. He can hear their voices, angry and urgent.

"What are you doing here?" Alex asks.

"What are *you* doing with your thesis?" Pauline replies.

Tim leans closer. They're talking about money—a lot of money. Something about a "formula" and a "USB drive." His heart beats faster. Could this help him pay Ronnie back?

Suddenly, Fiona appears in the hallway. She sees Tim standing by the door, hiding and listening. Tim turns nervously. "Oh, hi. I was just getting some air." Fiona doesn't look convinced. She walks past him and leaves.

Inside the stairwell, Alex finally says, "Fine. Go to my office and get the USB drive. It's shaped like a red fish. We'll talk later." He hands Pauline his office keys.
