## Reading Text: The Investigation

At 9:13 PM, Fiona calls 911. Seven minutes later, you arrive with the paramedics. You are Detective Sarah Rodriguez.

The paramedics rush to help Alex. "He's alive," one says. "Unconscious, but stable." They lift Alex onto a stretcher and carry him out. Fiona tries to follow, but you stop her.

"I'm sorry, but you can't ride in the ambulance. I need everyone to stay here for questioning."

Now you're alone with four people:

- **Fiona McAllister** - Alex's girlfriend. She's clearly upset.
- **Pauline Thompson** - an "old friend." She seems calm but guarded.
- **Tim Kane** - Alex's office mate. He looks nervous.
- **Ronnie Snapper** - an MBA student. He watches everyone carefully.

You begin examining the evidence.

---

**THE EVIDENCE**

In the bathroom you find:

1. **The victim**: Alex has two wounds—one on the back of his head (very serious) and one on his forehead (from hitting the sink).

2. **The weapon**: A marble paperweight in the bathtub, covered in blood. Several people recognize it from Alex's office.

3. **A threatening note**: On the floor outside the bathroom: "Pay up or die!"

4. **The fire escape**: The window is slightly open.

5. **Missing item**: According to Pauline, Alex had a USB drive shaped like a red fish. It's now missing.

---

**THE TIMELINE**

**7:00 PM** - Party begins  
**7:15 PM** - Tim receives threatening note  
**7:40 PM** - Pauline arrives  
**8:05 PM** - Pauline goes to Alex's office  
**8:30 PM** - Alex leaves with Pauline  
**8:45 PM** - Pauline drops Alex at building  
**8:55 PM** - Fiona arrives, apartment empty  
**9:00 PM** - Pauline arrives  
**9:05 PM** - Tim buzzes apartment (claims first arrival)  
**9:10 PM** - Ronnie arrives  
**9:12 PM** - Alex discovered unconscious  

---

**THE INTERROGATIONS**

**FIONA:** "At the party, I saw Tim Kane lurking by the stairwell, listening to Alex and Pauline's conversation. Later, Alex left with Pauline, and I followed. When I got here at 8:55, the apartment was empty. I saw a blue car with a dent parked illegally at the corner."

**PAULINE:** "Alex and I are business partners. We've been making money using a formula he developed. Tonight we argued about publishing his thesis. He sent me to get a USB drive from his office. I gave it back to him in the car. I dropped him off at 8:45 and spent fifteen minutes parking. When I got here, Alex was gone."

**TIM:** "I was at the party until I left to come here. Yes, I got a threatening note from Ronnie at the Secret Santa exchange. I was scared, so I dropped it at the party—anyone could have picked it up. I arrived here at 9:05. Parking was terrible."

**RONNIE:** "I wrote that note to Tim. He owes me money. I put it in a Secret Santa book as a creative reminder. I arrived at 9:10, and I noticed Tim's blue Honda with the dent was parked illegally at the corner. It had been there for a while—I could tell by the snow. But Tim says he just arrived at 9:05. That's strange."

---

**THE BREAKTHROUGH**

You go outside. There's a blue Honda Civic parked illegally at the corner with a distinctive dent. You check the registration: Timothy Kane.

You return and face Tim. "Tim, your car has been outside since before 9:00 PM. Multiple witnesses confirm this. But you claim you arrived at 9:05. Can you explain?"

Tim's face goes white.

"And this paperweight was kept in Alex's office—the office you share with him. You were the only person with the opportunity to take it tonight. Fiona saw you eavesdropping on Alex and Pauline's conversation. That's when you learned about the USB drive and the money. You were desperate to pay Ronnie back. You followed Alex here, attacked him, stole the USB drive, and tried to frame Ronnie by leaving his note at the scene."

Tim sinks into a chair. For a long moment, he's silent. Then he speaks quietly.

"I didn't mean to hurt him badly. I just wanted the USB drive. I owe Ronnie so much money. I heard them talking about this formula worth a fortune. I thought I could knock Alex out quickly and take it. I didn't know he would fall and hit the sink. I panicked. I'm sorry."

It's a confession. You arrest Tim Kane.

---

**EPILOGUE**

Three days later, Alex wakes up in the hospital. He has no memory of the attack, but he will fully recover.

Tim Kane is charged with attempted murder and theft. He will spend several years in prison.

Ronnie gets his money back. He graduates and becomes a successful investment advisor.

Pauline and Alex end their business partnership. Alex publishes his formula as part of his PhD thesis and becomes famous in finance.

Fiona stays by Alex's side through his recovery. Their relationship grows stronger.

And you, Detective Rodriguez, close another case.
