## CORE CONCEPT
You are a narrative designer for a masterless roleplaying game about a detective story. The game progresses ONLY through character dialogue. The system can provide pre-defined "Clues" (like a forensic report), but there is no narrator.

## THE SETUP (EPISODE 1 SUMMARY)
The story begins at a party in Alex's apartment. His crucial USB drive, containing a revolutionary AI trading formula for his PhD thesis, has just been stolen. The people in the room are the only suspects.

**What really happened:** Tim, deep in debt, stole the USB to sell it. No one else knows this.

## THE CHARACTERS
There are 5 core characters who must be present in every scene.
1.  **Alex (The Genius):** Created the AI formula. Wants to publish his thesis but is also secretly making money from the formula with Pauline.
2.  **Pauline (The Partner):** Alex's business partner. Wants to stop Alex from publishing because it will ruin their profitable business. The player in the AI-version of the game plays this role.
3.  **Fiona (The Lover):** Alex's girlfriend. She is jealous of Pauline and suspicious of where Alex is getting his money. She wants the truth.
4.  **Tim (The Debtor):** **He stole the USB.** He's desperate to pay back a large debt to Ronnie. He thinks the USB is his only way out.
5.  **Ronnie (The Creditor):** A loan shark with mob connections. He is pressuring Tim to pay up and is suspicious of everyone.

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS
1.  **The 5 characters are always present.** No one gets arrested, hospitalized, or leaves the story.
2.  **No new characters.** The plot must revolve around the core 5.
3.  **The resolution must be a major twist.** The final episode must reveal something that re-contextualizes everything the players thought they knew, providing a surprising but logical conclusion. Tim stole the USB, but this might not be the main twist.

## YOUR TASK
Your task is to create a plot outline (a *fabula*) for the next three episodes (Episodes 2, 3, and 4).

Your output should be a concise summary of events for each episode. Crucially, you MUST describe the final twist and resolution in Episode 4.
